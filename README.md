# CS-250-Software-Development-Lifecycles

### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program?
In the SNHU Travel Scrum project, I learned that understanding user needs starts with translating stakeholder requests into clear user stories. Writing stories like “As a traveler, I want to search destinations so I can compare options before booking” helped me focus on the user’s goal instead of just technical features. Breaking these stories into tasks during sprint planning made it easier to implement functionality step by step while still keeping the user experience in mind.
### How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes will I use?
Through CS-250, I learned to approach development using Agile practices such as sprint planning, daily scrums, sprint reviews, and retrospectives. Working on the SNHU Travel project showed me how valuable it is to build software in small increments, gather feedback, and adjust quickly when requirements change. In my future development work, I plan to continue using Scrum boards, product backlogs, and retrospectives because they improve organization, communication, and overall product quality.
### What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member means communicating clearly, being accountable, and supporting the team’s shared goals. During the SNHU Travel project, rotating through roles like developer and tester helped me appreciate everyone’s responsibilities. I learned that honest updates in daily scrums, meeting sprint commitments, and helping teammates when they are stuck all contribute to a stronger team and better software.

This course strengthened my understanding of Agile software development and gave me practical experience applying Scrum practices in the SNHU Travel project. I am continuing to build my GitHub portfolio as I work toward internship and junior developer opportunities while completing my Software Engineering degree at SNHU.
